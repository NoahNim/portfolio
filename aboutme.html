          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Noah Medoff. I was born in the year 1990. I was born in Columbia, Maryland. I lived in Maryland until
          the age of 20, when I traveled around the country for a few years. I also would goto Virginia to take
          care of my ailing grandmother. In 2013, I moved to Seattle. I decided to start teaching myself programming
          in 2014, I have taken some classes through Code Fellows and General Assemby. In 2018 I began attending Epicodus, where
          I hope to learn even more about coding.</p>
